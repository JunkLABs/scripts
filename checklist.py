This script takes a directory path as an argument, searches it recursively, and outputs the files in a PlainTasks 
checklist, except for folder and files that start with a period. Windows can't handle outputting checkboxes, so for now it uses a *. 
Yes this requires Python 3. If you can't use 3 just change the print functions, but you really should be using 3.
